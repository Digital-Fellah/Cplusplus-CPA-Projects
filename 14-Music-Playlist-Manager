"""
EXPLANATION OF THE CODE

The program starts by including necessary libraries (iostream, vector, string, algorithm).
A vector<string> named playlist is used to store songs.
Functions are declared and defined for adding a song (addSong), creating a playlist (createPlaylist), shuffling the playlist (shufflePlaylist), and displaying the playlist (displayPlaylist).
In main(), songs are added to the playlist using addSong.
The playlist is then created and displayed using createPlaylist and displayPlaylist.
The playlist is shuffled using shufflePlaylist and displayed again using displayPlaylist.
