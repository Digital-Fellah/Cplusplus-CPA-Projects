"""
EXPLANATION OF THE CODE

The program defines an abstract base class MediaFile with a pure virtual method play() to simulate playing different types of media files.
Three derived classes (MP3File, WAVFile, FLACFile) inherit from MediaFile and override the play() method with specific implementations for MP3, WAV, and FLAC files.
In the main() function, instances of each file type are created (mp3, wav, flac) and their play() methods are called to demonstrate polymorphism.
"""


"""
NOTIONS COVERED

Polymorphism: Different file types (MP3File, WAVFile, FLACFile) inherit from a common base class (MediaFile) and override a virtual method (play()).
Virtual Methods: The play() method in the base class is declared as virtual and overridden in derived classes to provide specific behavior for each media type.
Abstraction: The MediaFile class is abstract with a pure virtual method (play()), ensuring that all derived classes provide their own implementation.
