"""
EXPLANATION OF THE CODE

The program generates a random number between 1 and 100 using std::rand() % 100 + 1.
It initializes a loop (do-while) where the user can input guesses until they correctly guess the number.
Each guess is compared against the randomly generated secretNumber.
If the guess matches secretNumber, a congratulatory message is displayed along with the number of attempts.
If the guess is too low or too high, appropriate feedback is given to guide the user towards the correct number.
