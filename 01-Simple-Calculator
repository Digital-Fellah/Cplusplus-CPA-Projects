"""
EXPLANATION OF THE CODE

Include iostream: This line includes the standard input/output stream library, allowing the program to interact with the user through the console.
Using namespace std: This directive allows the use of standard C++ libraries such as cout and cin without prefixing them with std::.
Main function: The entry point of the program where execution begins.
Variable Declaration: Declares variables num1, num2 for operands, op for operator, and result to store the outcome of arithmetic operations.
User Interaction: Displays welcome message and prompts user to enter two numbers and an operator.
Input Handling: Reads user inputs (num1, op, num2) using cin.
Arithmetic Operations: Uses a switch statement to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division based on the operator entered.
Output: Displays the calculated result of the arithmetic operation.
