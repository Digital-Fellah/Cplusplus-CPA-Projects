EXPLANATION OF THE CODE

The program starts by greeting the player and asking for their name.
It presents the player with a scenario in a forest and offers a choice between two paths.
Depending on the player's choice, different outcomes are displayed using a switch statement.
Finally, the game ends with a message thanking the player for playing.
