"""
EXPLANATION OF THE CODE

The program starts by including necessary libraries (iostream, cstdlib, ctime) for input/output operations, random number generation, and time access respectively.
It initializes variables secretNumber to hold a random number between 1 and 100, guess to store the user's input, and attempts to count the number of guesses.
The game begins with a welcoming message and prompts the user to enter their guess.
Inside the do-while loop, it compares the user's guess with secretNumber and provides feedback (too low, too high, or correct).
The loop continues until the user guesses the correct number.
Once the correct number is guessed, it displays a congratulatory message along with the number of attempts made.
