EXPLANATION OF THE CODE

WeatherStation Class:
Defines a class WeatherStation with private members location, temperature, and humidity.
Includes a static member totalReadings to count how many weather stations have been created.
Provides a constructor to initialize the WeatherStation object with location, temperature, and humidity.
displayWeather() method prints out the current weather information (temperature and humidity) for a specific location.
getTotalReadings() is a static method that returns the total number of weather stations created.
Main Function:
Creates two instances of WeatherStation (station1 and station2) with different locations and weather conditions.
Calls the displayWeather() method for each station to show their respective weather information.
Calls getTotalReadings() to display the total number of weather station instances created.
