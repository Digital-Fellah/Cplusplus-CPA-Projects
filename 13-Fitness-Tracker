"""
EXPLANATION OF THE CODE

The program starts by including necessary libraries (iostream and string).
It defines functions for calculating calories burned (calculateCaloriesBurned) and calories consumed (calculateCaloriesConsumed).
The calculateCaloriesBurned function determines calories burned based on exercise type and duration.
The calculateCaloriesConsumed function calculates total daily calories consumed from breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
The suggestWorkoutPlan function suggests a workout plan based on the user's fitness level.
In main(), sample input values are provided (exercise type, duration, calories consumed for each meal, fitness level).
Results are calculated and displayed using function calls to calculate and output calories burned, calories consumed, and suggested workout plan.
